Hi,

I'm Thomas. My trade is software engineering, and these days I mostly dabble in
data that doesn't fit in memory. I'm interested in query engines, distributed
computing, databases and performance. I favor functional over imperative
programming, and my favorite programming languages I'd like to know better and
use more often are Rust and Haskell.
